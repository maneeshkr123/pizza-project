Founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald in the early 1940s, McDonald’s pioneered the ‘Speedee Service System’ – a simple method of preparing hamburgers that used production line efficiency in a restaurant.mcdonalds foundersThe service and the restaurant, which served up simple hamburgers and family meals in a small California town, proved to be a hit. Tired of waiting for hours for their food in other nearby restaurants, visitors flocked to the brothers’ restaurant for tasty, affordable food that arrived at their tables in mere minutes.Despite its success, however, it took McDonald’s a surprisingly long time to become one of the world’s top restaurant brands. The company only filed for a trademark in 1961, describing itself as a ‘drive through restaurant’ and introducing its mascot – Ronald McDonald – in the same year.

Two brothers from Kansas founded Pizza Hut in 1958. The $600 start-up money was borrowed from their mother, the equipment was secondhand and the furnishings of the restaurant, which was located at a busy crossroads at the center of Wichita, Kansas, were very modest, But brothers Frank and Dan Carney hit a bull's eye in 1958 when they opened their first pizza restaurant, which they called “Pizza Hut”, referring to the rather inconspicuous building. Today, more than 50 years later, there are more than 13,000 Pizza Huts in over 100 countries worldwide. A success story that is proof of the good hunch of the two brothers, college students at the time, who followed up on a suggestion made by a friend of the family and believed in a gastronomy concept still relatively unknown in America at that time.

Das erste Pizza Hut RestaurantIt wasn’t long before Pizza Hut became a registered trademark and the first franchisees were found. Only ten years after the grand opening in Wichita, more than one million guests had been welcomed in 310 restaurants and with a first branch in Canada, the conquest of the international market had begun. A little later, in 1969, the red roof was introduced as the company logo, which was soon to become world famous as an easily recognized guarantee of crispy pizza, delicious pasta and friendly service in a pleasant atmosphere.

Rapid expansion
Pizza Hut had long been offering other products such as pasta in addition to pizza by the time it went public in 1972. The 1000th restaurant was opened in the same year ? in Wichita, of course. This rapid expansion continued.

After opening new restaurants in Japan and England, the 100th international restaurant began operations in Australia in 1976. This brought the total number of restaurants to 2000. After the shareholders approved the takeover by Pepsico Inc., the steady upwards trend continued uninterrupted. In 1977, the opening of the 3000th restaurant in the USA (in Texas) was celebrated. In 1980, Pan Pizzas with individually selected toppings were introduced worldwide in all Pizza Hut restaurants. Today they are an absolute classic and they will undoubtedly remain that way.
